# TaskManger
Task Manager is a simple console app for managing tasks. It allows adding, displaying, marking as completed, and deleting tasks. Data is stored in a CSV file to retain it after closing. The user selects options by entering a number. The program runs in a loop, enabling multiple operations and handling invalid inputs.
